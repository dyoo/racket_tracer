***** CURRENT ISSUES*****
- planet load line
- documented examples in planet runnable (fixed but not loaded to planet)
- (define (foo x) x) --> visual glitch (eric)
- source code appears on left before jumping to right (chrome) (eric)
- dragability not discoverable and jerky (eric)
- dragging sluggish (eric)
- easy way to expand/contract code window (eric)
- whole top bar of code window is clickable (eric)
- keep track of what was clicked on highlight --> some way to tie function that you clicked to highlight in code
- double click to expand or collapse code pane (anywhere on the page)
- margin for the code (guillaume)
- larger target for the close bar of code pane (guillaume)
- click on argument and highlight arguments (guillaume)
- some way to get to definition of a function (guillaume)
- code-paste a test case for nodes i have identified are bad (guillaume)
- show all check-expects, failed in red (guillaume)
- display of check expects. arrow to false is confusing. (guillaume)
- scroll code with mouse drag (guillaume)
- wrap long lines in the code (guillaume)
- scroll with arrows (guillaume)
- highlighting source location of a lambda on click (guillaume)
- context of lst in lambda (guillaume)
- color of code highlight, red means error (guillaume)
- deleting temp files that are generated (guillaume)
- not opening a new tab each time (guillaume)
- documentation --> evaluation tree = false (shriram)
- whether or not function clicked on in tabbar should open code pane and highlight (danny)
- language level printer
- double check browser compatibility error message
- function in map --> display name as function name not lambda (guillame)
- ordering of actual and expected in check expects
- ability to scroll off top and bottom of code pane
- what happens when you error
- not dying on contracts (vs skipping contracts)
- multiple files
- language level sensitive printing (and other issues)
- display of correct check expects --> highlight subfunctions that are the same
- testing with large images (equal vs eq? on images)
- test with images
- data uri schemes (or not)... but someway to display images on tracer
- warning on unsupported/untested browsers
- graduated set of demos
- plumbing for wescheme
- plumbing for dr racket
- why line paper
- If tree of traces is empty don't open index.html --> message to the user
- Contracts
- Expand collapse --> up down arrows?
- testing with bootstrap code

***** WISHLIST *****
- Tracing failed check expects
- Dr Racket highlighting syntax / Correspondence between input/output and code
- Tracing errors
- Actual formals
- Matching parentheses on display on hover(?)
- Bad printing - use *sl printing - constructor-syntax
    - Differing syntax on lists at top level. Fix: printer from language level, clear 
      one is from code other is actual.
    - Dealing with large flat data structures

***** THINK ABOUT *****
- Other arguments de-expand when you shift your focus
- Google maps style zoom for arguments
- Formals/actuals not intuitive
- Make-heap and args juxtaposition not clear
- ... not necessarily clear - additional complexity

***** FIXED ISSUES *****
- behavior when nothing in the file to trace (6/29)
- Bug with hover remaining blue too long
- danny's pull request
- Call table
    - Rearrange call table to be vertical rather than horizontal. See how we like it
    - Coloring of arguments or some other separation between them
- Parent calls visible at all levels --> scroll with the bar
- Mouse-over scroll to right rather than using scroll bar (6/21)
- tracing failed check-expects
- Autoscroll to most recently expanded argument
- Jumpiness of tab bar movement (6/21)
- x is delete button, actually minimizes
- bug lets shrunken call args be expanded
- more no click interaction
- ability to expand arguments from shrunken call - lack confusing
- expand arguments is first thing - separate expansion of args and expansion
expansion
