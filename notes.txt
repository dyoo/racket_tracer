***** CURRENT ISSUES*****
- currently able to click on calls without source location
- (7/11) Write up
    - Data flow
- Bugs from emails
- (this week) HOF
- Printing
    - function in map --> display name as function name not lambda (guillame)
    - Dealing with large flat data structures
- Language levels
    - Printing
    - Error checking
    - How we do let, define etc
- Check expect
    - show all check-expects, failed in red (guillaume)
    - Marking correct check expects
    - Display of check expect traces
- GUI
    - clickable when can't drag (display still too small)
    - (this week) scroll with arrows (guillaume)
    - (define (foo x) x) --> visual glitch (eric)
    - source code appears on left before jumping to right (chrome) (eric)
    - click on argument and highlight arguments (guillaume)
- Images
    - (this week) Images in source code
- Integration
    - wescheme (not our issue?)
    - dr racket (tool --> .plt)
- Testing
    - (this week) bootstrap
    - (7/11) world
    - (this week) multiple files
- context of lst in lambda (guillaume)
- deleting temp files that are generated (guillaume)
- not dying on contracts (vs skipping contracts)

***** WISHLIST *****
- world film strip GUI
    - What if there's no to-draw --> major change to GUI
    - how do you display stop-when?
    - which worlds do you display?
    - is the focus the drawn world? Or the world itself?
- Play button to animate order of calls in syntax highlights
- code-paste a test case for nodes i have identified are bad (guillaume)
- Tracing errors
- Actual formals
- Matching parentheses on display on hover(?)

***** THINK ABOUT *****
- Other arguments de-expand when you shift your focus
- Google maps style zoom for arguments
- Formals/actuals not intuitive
- Make-heap and args juxtaposition not clear
- ... not necessarily clear - additional complexity

***** FIXED ISSUES *****
- whether or not function clicked on in tabbar should open code pane and highlight (danny)
- documentation --> evaluation tree = false (shriram)
- images in output
- color of code highlight, red means error (guillaume)
- graduated set of demos
- why line paper
- Expand collapse --> up down arrows?
- Tracing failed check expects
- Dr Racket highlighting syntax / Correspondence between input/output and code
- ordering of actual and expected in check expects
- scroll code with mouse drag (guillaume)
- highlighting source location of a lambda on click (guillaume)
- fixed jump to definition of check expects. (7/1)
- fib or fac demos in addition to factorial demo (early 7)
- push to planet (early 7)
- heap demo (large deeply nested data structures) (early 7)
- planet load line (early 7)
- documented examples in planet runnable (fixed but not loaded to planet) (early 7)
- double click to expand or collapse code pane (anywhere on the page) (6/29)
- show whole top bar of code window is clickable (eric)(7/1)
- pretty up body button (7/1)
- make the body word a body button (7/1)
- don't lose the body button (7/1)
- If tree of traces is empty don't open index.html --> message to the user (6/29)
- some way to get to definition of a function (guillaume) (6/29)
- margin for the code (guillaume) (6/29)
- keep track of what was clicked on highlight --> some way to tie function that you clicked to highlight in code (6/29)
- dragability discoverable (6/29)
- title for page (6/29)
- warning on unsupported/untested browsers (6/28)
- behavior when nothing in the file to trace (6/29)
- Bug with hover remaining blue too long
- danny's pull request
- Call table
    - Rearrange call table to be vertical rather than horizontal. See how we like it
    - Coloring of arguments or some other separation between them
- Parent calls visible at all levels --> scroll with the bar
- Mouse-over scroll to right rather than using scroll bar (6/21)
- tracing failed check-expects
- Autoscroll to most recently expanded argument
- Jumpiness of tab bar movement (6/21)
- x is delete button, actually minimizes
- bug lets shrunken call args be expanded
- more no click interaction
- ability to expand arguments from shrunken call - lack confusing
- expand arguments is first thing - separate expansion of args and expansion
expansion
