ability to expand arguments from shrunken call - lack confusing
bad printing - use *sl printing - constructor-syntax
two lists confusing at top level
formals/actuals not intuitive
need to correspond between input/output and code
just formals not enough
highlighting original code from tracer
arrow new syntax
make-heap and args juxtaposition not clear
... not necessarily clear - additional complexity
expand arguments is first thing - separate expansion of args and expansion
expansion
google maps style zoom for arguments
children start out expanded
gray highlights are useful - make current display readable in drracket
deexpand other branches, in general, we are moving on to a different branch
bug lets shrunken call args be expanded
may need more than highlighting source
x is delete button, actually minimizes
don't show things as leaves unless they are leaves
