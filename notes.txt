***** CURRENT ISSUES*****
- Call table
    - Rearrange call table to be vertical rather than horizontal. See how we like it
    - Coloring of arguments or some other separation between them
- Parent calls visible at all levels --> scroll with the bar
- Autoscroll to most recently expanded argument
- If tree of traces is empty don't open index.html --> message to the user
- Bug with hover remaining blue too long
- Check-expects
- Contracts
- Jumpiness of tab bar movement
- Mouse-over scroll to right rather than using scroll bar
- Expand collapse --> up down arrows?
- Some way to prevent mouseovers from expanding/collapsing items

***** WISHLIST *****
- Tracing failed check expects
- Dr Racket highlighting syntax / Correspondence between input/output and code
- Tracing errors
- Actual formals
- Matching parentheses on display on hover(?)
- Bad printing - use *sl printing - constructor-syntax
    - Differing syntax on lists at top level. Fix: printer from language level, clear 
      one is from code other is actual.
    - Dealing with large flat data structures

***** THINK ABOUT *****
- Other arguments de-expand when you shift your focus
- Google maps style zoom for arguments
- Formals/actuals not intuitive
- Make-heap and args juxtaposition not clear
- ... not necessarily clear - additional complexity

***** FIXED ISSUES *****
- x is delete button, actually minimizes
- bug lets shrunken call args be expanded
- more no click interaction
- ability to expand arguments from shrunken call - lack confusing
- expand arguments is first thing - separate expansion of args and expansion
expansion
